## Why use Base?

Base is a foundation for creating modular, unit testable and highly pluggable server-side node.js APIs.

* Go from zero to working application within minutes
* Use [community plugins](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/keyword/baseplugin) to add feature-functionality to your application
* Create your own custom plugins to add features
* Like building blocks, plugins are stackable. Allowing you to build [sophisticated applications](#toolkit-suite) from simple plugins. Moreover, those applications can also be used as plugins themselves. 

Most importantly, once you learn Base, you will be familiar with the core API of all applications built on Base. This means you will not only benefit as a developer, but as a user as well.

### Guiding principles

The core team follows these principles to help guide API decisions:

- **Compact API surface**: The smaller the API surface, the easier the library will be to learn and use.
- **Easy to extend**: Implementors can use any npm package, and write plugins in pure JavaScript. If you're building complex apps, Base dramatically simplifies inheritance.
- **Easy to test**: No special setup should be required to unit test `Base` or base plugins 
- **100% Node.js core style**
  * No API sugar (left for higher level projects)
  * Written in readable vanilla JavaScript

### Minimal API surface

[The API](#api) was designed to provide only the minimum necessary functionality for creating a useful application, with or without [plugins](#plugins). 

**Base core**

Base itself ships with only a handful of [useful methods](#api), such as:

- `.set`: for setting values on the instance
- `.get`: for getting values from the instance
- `.has`: to check if a property exists on the instance
- `.define`: for setting non-enumerable values on the instance
- `.use`: for adding plugins

**Be generic**

When deciding on method to add or remove, we try to answer these questions: 

1. Will all or most Base applications need this method? 
1. Will this method encourage practices or enforce conventions that are beneficial to implementors?
1. Can or should this be done in a plugin instead?

### Composability

**Plugin system**

It couldn't be easier to extend Base with any features or custom functionality you can think of. 

Base plugins are just functions that take an instance of `Base`:

```js
var base = new Base();

function plugin(base) {
  // do plugin stuff, in pure JavaScript
}
// use the plugin
base.use(plugin);
```

Add "smart plugin" functionality with the [base-plugins][] plugin. 

**Inheritance**

Easily inherit Base using `.extend`:

```js
var Base = require('{%= name %}');

function MyApp() {
  Base.call(this);
}
Base.extend(MyApp);

var app = new MyApp();
app.set('a', 'b');
app.get('a');
//=> 'b';
```

**Inherit or instantiate with a namespace**

By default, the `.get`, `.set` and `.has` methods set and get values from the root of the `base` instance. You can customize this using the `.namespace` method exposed on the exported function. For example:

```js
var Base = require('{%= name %}');
// get and set values on the `base.cache` object
var base = Base.namespace('cache');

var app = base();
app.set('foo', 'bar');
console.log(app.cache.foo);
//=> 'bar'
```
</details>


## Install

**NPM**

## Install

{%= include("install-npm", {save: true}) %}

**yarn**

Install with [yarn](yarnpkg.com):

```sh
$ yarn add base && yarn upgrade
```

## Usage

```js
var Base = require('base');
var app = new Base();

// set a value
app.set('foo', 'bar');
console.log(app.foo);
//=> 'bar'

// register a plugin
app.use(function() {
  // do stuff (see API docs for ".use")
});
```

## Toolkit suite

Base is used as the foundation for all of the applications in the [toolkit suite](https://github.com/node-toolkit/getting-started) (except for [enquirer][]):

**Building blocks**

- [base][]: (you are here!) framework for rapidly creating high quality node.js applications, using plugins like building blocks.
- [templates][]: API for managing template collections and rendering templates with any node.js template engine. Can be used as the basis for creating a static site generator, blog framework, documentaton system, and so on.
- [enquirer][]: composable, plugin-based prompt system (Base is used in [prompt-base][], the core prompt module that powers all prompt plugins)

**Lifecycle**

Developer frameworks and command line tools that address common phases of the software development lifecycle. Each of these tools can be used entirely standalone, but they work even better together.

- [generate][]: create projects
- [assemble][]: build projects
- [verb][]: document projects
- [update][]: maintain projects
