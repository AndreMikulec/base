## What is Base?

Base is a framework for rapidly creating node.js applications, with a handful of commonly needed methods, like `.set`, `.get` and `.has`, and a plugin system and conventions that make it easy to extend your application with custom code written in pure JavaScript.

## Usage

```js
var base = require('{%= name %}');
```

**inherit**

```js
function App() {
  base.call(this);
}
base.extend(App);

var app = new App();
app.set('a', 'b');
app.get('a');
//=> 'b';
```

**instantiate**

```js
var app = base();
app.set('foo', 'bar');
console.log(app.foo);
//=> 'bar'
```

**Inherit or instantiate with a namespace**

By default, the `.get`, `.set` and `.has` methods set and get values from the root of the `base` instance. You can customize this using the `.namespace` method exposed on the exported function. For example:

```js
var Base = require('{%= name %}');
// get and set values on the `base.cache` object
var base = Base.namespace('cache');

var app = base();
app.set('foo', 'bar');
console.log(app.cache.foo);
//=> 'bar'
```

The following node.js applications were built with `Base`:

- [assemble][]
- [verb][]
- [generate][]
- [scaffold][]
- [boilerplate][]
